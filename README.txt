Project Title: Event Center Website

Overview:
This project is a multi-page responsive website for a mock event center. It includes several themed event pages, a homepage, and a location/contact page. The site uses HTML and CSS with organized folders for maintainability.

Project Structure:
- .html/         → Contains all HTML files for the site (e.g., index, events, menu, contact, location)
- .css/          → Contains individual CSS stylesheets for each page and shared styles (e.g., nav.css, style.css)
- images/        → Contains all image assets used across the site (e.g., homepage hero, themed event images)

HTML Files:
- index.html     → Homepage with hero image and navigation
- events.html    → Displays event categories and event-specific sections
- menu.html      → Contains catering menu details
- contact.html   → Contact form and information
- location.html  → Map and address for the venue

Styling:
- Each HTML page is styled with a dedicated CSS file stored in `.css/`
- nav.css handles consistent navigation styling
- Responsive layout is implemented for mobile friendliness

Assets:
- All image files are stored in the `images/` folder and correctly linked using relative paths (e.g., `../images/fall.jpg`)

Testing:
- Verified rendering in Chrome and Firefox
- Navigation links work across all pages
- Pages are responsive on desktop and mobile screen sizes
- All images load correctly after path updates
- HTML and CSS are cleanly separated and modular
